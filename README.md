# Power Grid Simulation and Fault Analysis

Welcome to the **Probabilistic Analysis of Distance Protection Accuracy in Power Grids Using Pandapower** project! This repository contains tools and scripts for simulating power grid dynamics, analyzing fault scenarios, and visualizing results. The project is designed to analyze the performance of pair-installed distance protection devices in the AC grid.

## üöÄ Features

- **Distance Protection Power Grid Simulation**: Scan the network topology and implement distance protection logic. Conduct short-circuit simulation at each line.
- **Simulation on real and one-year-long profiles**: Perform year-long simulations with dynamic load power and wind power profile (110kV) and also periodic result saving.
- **Fault Detection and Protection**: (optional) Adjust protection zones dynamically based on real-time measurement data.
- **Custom Visualization**: Generate insightful plots for load power, wind power, and short-circuit initial power flow.
- **Modular Design**: Easily extendable with shared libraries for network creation, result processing, and profile extraction.

## üìÇ Project Structure

### Key Files and Directories

1. **`timeseries_combine_fault_check.py`**  
   - Main script for running the time-series simulation.
   - Implements dynamic profile updates and fault simulation.

2. **`shared/`**  
   - Contains reusable modules for network creation, profile extraction, protection zone adjustments, and result processing:
     - `library.py`: Core utilities for creating and managing the power grid network.
     - `extract_profile.py`: Handles dynamic profile loading.
     - `protection_border_adjust.py`: Adjusts protection zones based on measurement data.
     - `result_processing.py`: Tools for visualizing and processing simulation results.

3. **`grid_data_sheet.xlsx`**  
   - Excel file containing the grid configuration data. (Example grid configurations from the Disego project)

4. **`fault_detection_check_BE_AB1.xlsx`**  
   - Static measurement data for fault evaulation and optimization.

5. **`simulation_results/`**  
   - Directory where simulation results are saved in `.xlsx` format.

6. **`external zones/`**  
   - Contains external zone settings for comparison purposes. (If a well-tuned distance protection parameters are formed, adjust the format to the example excel)

7. **`sc_pf_half_position/`**  
   - Stores short-circuit analysis plots. (For my usage of analyzing the fault current directrion and magnitude)

8. **`thesis/`**  
   - Supporting documents and resources related to the project.
